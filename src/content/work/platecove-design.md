### Project Overview:
Designed to reflect the charm and character of Plate Cove, this website offers a seamless user experience across devices, inviting users to explore local events, discover nearby attractions, and engage with community initiatives. This website serves as a vital resource for all who call Plate Cove home as well as visitors looking to explore the area.

As the software developer behind the Plate Cove community website, I took a comprehensive approach to design and development, utilizing a combination of tools and techniques to bring the project to life.

Collaboration and iteration were key components of the development process, as I worked closely with stakeholders to gather feedback, iterate on design concepts, and refine functionality to meet the evolving needs of the Plate Cove community.
