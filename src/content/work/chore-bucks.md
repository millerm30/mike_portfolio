**Project Overview:** <br>
This full-stack web app was developed as part of my studies with Get Coding, where I had the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of modern web development while tackling real-world challenges. Leveraging ReactJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, alongside a suite of backend technologies, this project exemplifies my dedication to mastering the art and science of full-stack development.

**Frontend Development:** <br>
With a foundation in ReactJS and TypeScript, I crafted a dynamic and intuitive user interface that embodies the principles of modern web design. Tailwind CSS empowered me to style the frontend with precision and efficiency, while Framer Motion added delightful animations and transitions to elevate the user experience.

**Backend Development:** <br>
On the backend, I utilized Node.js, Express, and a host of other tools to build a robust and secure API, ensuring the seamless flow of data between the frontend and backend components. Technologies such as bcrypt, nodemailer, jsonwebtoken, and PostgreSQL were instrumental in implementing features such as user authentication, chore management, and email notifications.

**Deployment & Infrastructure:** <br>
In deploying the web app, I embraced AWS services such as EC2 and RDS (PostgreSQL) to host the frontend, backend, and database components. This hands-on experience with AWS infrastructure management, coupled with the manual setup of ECS and RDS instances, deepened my understanding of cloud computing and server-side operations.

**Inspiration and Impact:** <br>
Inspired by my own experiences with household chores and motivated by the desire to make chores more engaging for children, this project represents a personal and educational journey in creating a solution that combines technology with real-world challenges. By gamifying chores and introducing concepts of responsibility and financial literacy, the app aims to empower children while simplifying chore management for families.

**Conclusion:** <br>
In conclusion, this full-stack web app stands as a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and growth as a developer. Developed during my time with Get Coding, it reflects not only my technical skills but also my passion for leveraging technology to solve meaningful problems and make a positive impact in the world.
