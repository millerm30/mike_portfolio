**Project Overview:** <br>
My first project during my time in school was a dynamic to-do list web application, inspired by Trello's organizational capabilities. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project served as my introduction to web development, combining essential frontend technologies with practical features for task management.

**Core Features:** <br>
**Task Management:** Users can create, and delete tasks, organizing them into customizable lists for efficient workflow management.<br>
**Local Storage:** Leveraging the power of local storage, the application stores tasks locally within the user's browser, ensuring data persistence across sessions.<br>
**Weather Integration:** Utilizing the OpenWeather API, the application provides users with real-time weather updates based on their location, enhancing usability and context.<br>
**Local Date and Time:** The inclusion of the user's local date and time enhances the user experience, providing valuable context for task scheduling and prioritization.<br>
**Fully Operational Calculator:** To further expand the application's functionality, I integrated a fully operational calculator, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic calculations directly within the app.

**Technologies Used:** <br>
**HTML:** For structuring the web pages and defining the content.<br>
**CSS:** For styling the user interface and enhancing visual appeal.<br>
**JavaScript:** For implementing interactivity, data manipulation, and integrating external APIs.<br>
**Local Storage:** For persistently storing user data within the browser.<br>
**OpenWeather API:** For retrieving real-time weather information based on the user's location.

**Impact and Learning:** <br>
This project served as a pivotal learning experience, providing me with hands-on exposure to essential web development concepts and technologies. From HTML and CSS for frontend design to JavaScript for dynamic functionality, I gained valuable insights into the fundamentals of web development. Additionally, integrating external APIs like the OpenWeather API expanded my understanding of data fetching and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

**Conclusion:** <br>
In conclusion, my to-do list Trello clone project represents the beginning of my journey in web development, laying the foundation for future projects and learning opportunities. Through experimentation, iteration, and hands-on experience, I honed my skills and deepened my understanding of web technologies, setting the stage for continued growth and innovation in the field.
